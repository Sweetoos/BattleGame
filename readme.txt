i write a simple game, where 2 players face each other in a battle
my first bigger project (if i can say it is a project, more like testing platform after i've learnt sth)
i'm writing this program just to learn cpp
the game probably won't be finished, but the things that i've been learning, i'm trying to implement to the game somehow 
and try to optimize it
oh and i'm writing it on linux
